## â€œMRevolutiondata.xlsx"
This file contains raw data associated with size distributions in natural populations, measurements of routine metabolic rates in wild-caught fish, and measurements of routine metabolic rates in laboratory-reared fish:
- Body size: Body mass data (log10-transformed in grams). Additional columns include collection site, drainage, sex (F = female, M = male), and sulfidic/nonsulfidic (depending on the presence of H2S at the collection site). 
- MR wild-caught: Routine metabolic rates (log10-transformed in mgO2/hr). Additional columns include collection site, drainage, sex (F = female, M = male), sulfidic/nonsulfidic (depending on the presence of H2S at the collection site), temperature at which measurement took place (in degrees Celsius), and mass of the focal individual (log10-transformed in grams). 
- MR lab-reared: Routine metabolic rates (log10-transformed in mgO2/hr). Additional columns include collection site, drainage, sex (F = female, M = male), sulfidic/nonsulfidic (depending on the presence of H2S at the collection site), temperature at which measurement took place (in degrees Celsius), and mass of the focal individual (log10-transformed in grams).
